# Integrated Use of Public Transport and Air Quality Data

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of public transport usage data and air quality index (AQI) data to assist urban planners and environmental agencies in Abu Dhabi. By analyzing these datasets together, we aim to provide actionable insights for sustainable urban development.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- JSON library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integrated-urban-planning.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd integrated-urban-planning
   
3. Install the required Python packages:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the datasets:
   - `Public_Transport_Usage_Statistics_Abu_Dhabi.csv`
   - `Air_Quality_Index_Data_Abu_Dhabi.json`

2. Run the Python script to perform the analysis:
   bash
   python analyze_data.py
   

3. The script will generate a plot showing the correlation between public transport usage and air quality over time.

## Data Description
- **Public Transport Usage Dataset**: Contains statistics on passenger counts and peak usage times.
- **Air Quality Index Dataset**: Provides real-time and historical AQI readings for different locations in Abu Dhabi.
